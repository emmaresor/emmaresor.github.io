Implementation:
	On the whole, I believe that I implemented my website adequately, but 
likely used inefficient ways to accomplish simple attributes. For example, I 
have a working menu bar with a decorative band underneath using flexbox, but I 
think that there is likely a simpler way to do the same thing.
	I do think that I correctly implemented my links to other pages and 
stuck to the HTML content-only, CSS styling-only rules. 
	I did have one error in the CSS file when I ran it through the validator,
but I could not figure out what was causing it. It says: "Value Error : position 
attempt to find a semi-colon before the property name. add it" but there was no
semi-colon or colon missing/in the wrong place.

Collaboration:
	I discussed my design with Dan Katz, but in no great detail, and visited
no TAs. I did however use google and other websites that TAs posted on Piazza. 
For example: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ and tips 
on redirecting.

Time Spent:
	I spent roughly 10 hours on this assignment. Much of that was spent 
making small changes to see how it looked, not necessary ones.
