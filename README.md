Personal Portfolio Website |
COMP20: Web Programming, Spring 2017 |
By: Emma Resor
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implementation:
	On the whole, I believe that I implemented my website adequately, but 
likely used inefficient ways to accomplish simple attributes. For example, I 
have a working menu bar with a decorative band underneath using flexbox, but I 
think that there is likely a simpler way to do the same thing.
	I do think that I correctly implemented my links to other pages and 
stuck to the HTML content-only, CSS styling-only rules. 
	I do have some warnings from the CSS validator with the webkit stuff.

Collaboration:
	I discussed my design with Dan Katz, but in no great detail, and visited
no TAs. I did however use google and other websites that TAs posted on Piazza. 
For example: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ and tips 
on redirecting.

Time Spent:
	I spent roughly 5 hours on this assignment. Much of that was spent 
making small changes to see how it looked, not necessary ones.
